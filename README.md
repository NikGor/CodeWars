# Codewars Solutions :rocket:

This repository contains my solutions to various Codewars katas. Codewars is a platform that provides coding challenges (katas) for developers to improve their coding skills and algorithmic thinking. :computer:

## What is Codewars? :question:

Codewars is a community-driven platform that allows developers to challenge themselves with coding exercises called katas. Katas are bite-sized coding challenges that range in difficulty from easy to very hard. Each kata comes with a specific problem to solve and test cases to verify the correctness of your solution. :muscle:

## How to Contribute :handshake:

If you want to contribute to this repository, you can do so by adding your own solutions to existing katas or by adding new katas. Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account. :fork_and_knife:
2. Create a new branch for your changes. :seedling:
3. Add your solution(s) to the appropriate kata folder. :page_with_curl:
4. Commit your changes. :white_check_mark:
5. Push your changes to your forked repository. :arrow_up:
6. Create a Pull Request to merge your changes into the main repository. :arrows_clockwise:

## Disclaimer :warning:

These solutions are my own work and are provided as-is. While I strive for accuracy and efficiency in my solutions, there might be alternate or more optimal solutions available. The purpose of this repository is to share and learn from each other, so feel free to suggest improvements or alternative solutions via Pull Requests or Issues. :bulb:

Happy coding! :tada:
